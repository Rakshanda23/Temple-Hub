12 Mahadev Jyotirlingas all in one location. This project is being created in order to digitise the Abhishieks performed in Shiva temples. The technique enables the general public to register for puja/havan without physically travelling to these locations. They only need to enter their basic information when signing up for an account on the system. The user can then register into the system using the login credentials provided at registration, after which the person is verified by the system upon login. At that point, the user is qualified to perform havan at any of Shiva's 12 jyotirlinga. The system's database is in full control of any prior havan donations or other user actions. After completing the form, the user can go to the payment page by scanning the QR Code. Everything is dynamic and pulled from a database.Along with a feedback form, the About us section also includes our contact information.
